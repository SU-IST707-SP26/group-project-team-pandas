### Introduction

This project aims to develop a predictive model for New York City restaurant health inspection grades. Currently, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) conducts restaurant inspections on a fixed schedule, typically once per year for all establishments. We propose to build a machine learning system that can identify restaurants at high risk of receiving poor grades (B or C) before their scheduled inspections occur.

Our approach represents a shift from the current reactive inspection model to a proactive, risk-based system. Instead of treating all restaurants equally regardless of their compliance history, our model will analyze multiple signals including restaurant characteristics (cuisine type, location, age), historical inspection patterns, violation trends, and neighborhood factors to prioritize high-risk establishments. This predictive capability would enable inspectors to focus their limited resources where they are most needed, potentially catching food safety issues before they result in public health incidents.

While past research has explored predictive models for restaurant inspections, our work is novel in several ways. First, we incorporate a richer feature set that includes temporal patterns and neighborhood-level characteristics beyond what previous studies have used. Second, we focus specifically on NYC's A/B/C grading system, which has direct business implications that make our predictions actionable for multiple stakeholders. Third, we design our model with interpretability as a core requirement, ensuring that predictions can be explained to restaurant owners and justified to the public.

If successful, three main groups benefit:

**1. NYC Department of Health (DOHMH)**

- Can schedule inspections more efficiently by focusing on high-risk restaurants first
- Reduces foodborne illness outbreaks by catching problems earlier
- Better allocation of limited inspection resources

**2. Restaurant Owners**

- Get early warning if they're at risk of a bad grade
- Can fix problems before the official inspection
- Avoid the revenue loss that comes with B or C grades (studies show 20-30% drop in customers)

**3. NYC Residents/Diners**

- Safer dining experiences
- More informed restaurant choices
- Fewer cases of food poisoning (NYC reports ~3,000 foodborne illness cases annually)
