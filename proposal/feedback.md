This is a solid proposal.  However, I'd like you to make sure you consider the ethical aspects here carefully; in particular, I want you to think a little about the burden of surveillance for the surveilled restaurant owner. It is certainly not cost-free, and it directing surveillance to specific areas may allow others to sneak by without being investigated.

So, if socio-economic factors (a restaurant is in a poorer area) are predictive of violations, and that increases the number of times I'm going to get visited by health inspector, does that mean I'm unwise to open a restaurant in a poorer neighborhood? So, wouldn't your methods drive restaurants out of poorer areas?  This hardly seems fair.  Moreover, if an area is "over-policed" it seems likely that this in itself will increase the number of violations identified, so this becomes a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.

This could lead to a different sort of question - specifically, what sort of surveillance pattern would allow you the best chances of identifying violations without placing undue burdens on restaurants in poorer areas?  This is still an ML problem, but it's a little different and would involve modeling and simulation with a longitudinal component.

I'll leave it to you to think about where you want to go; it is important that you be aware of ethical and systemic consequences.

SCORE: 5/5
